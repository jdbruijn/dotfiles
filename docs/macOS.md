# Configuration

A lot of the macOS configurations that you can do using a script, are not publicly documented. Some configurations, for example the [Dock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/dock), are also documented in the Apple's [Device Management documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement). The best resource however, is the [`macOS-defaults`][macos-defaults] project by [Yann Bertrand](https://github.com/yannbertrand). It contains a list of documented configurations and a great tool to find other configurations.

To use the [`macOS-defaults`][macos-defaults] tool to record configuration changes, you need to clone the [`macos-defaults`][macos-defaults] repository.

1. Clone the [`macos-defaults`][macos-defaults] repository.
   ```shell
   gh repo clone yannbertrand/macos-defaults
   ```
2. Start recording configuration changes and give the diff a name when prompted.
   ```shell
   ./diff.sh
   ```
3. Make the configuration changes you want. Note that this is only able to record changes to the `defaults`, so not all changes might be recorded.
4. Go back to the terminal where you started the script and press any key to stop recording. A diff of the configuration changes will be shown. Additionally you can view the complete configuration in `diffs` directory.
